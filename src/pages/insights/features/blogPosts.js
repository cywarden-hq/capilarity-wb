                        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">In the complex environment of cybersecurity, the approach to threat detection and response can significantly impact organizational resilience. The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) recorded over 30,000 new Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), half of which were classified as high or critical severity.</p>
                        
                        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed font-medium">The debate between using a few versatile patterns versus deploying hundreds of specific rules is central to optimizing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) systems. Let's dive into the technical rationale behind this choice and explore why fewer patterns often outperform an overwhelming number of rules.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">Configuring a SIEM or UEBA with hundreds of rules—as seen with tools like Splunk, QRadar, or ArcSight—presents daunting challenges:</p>

                            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 text-[#ff9d00]">1. High False Positives</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A system inundated with alerts becomes less effective. Each rule adds noise, and managing the volume of alerts from 500 rules leads to fatigue and potential oversight of real threats.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Rules-heavy systems consume considerable computational resources, slowing down event processing and response times.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Tuning hundreds of rules is labor-intensive and often impractical. This task demands a deep understanding of each rule's context and interdependencies.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Fixed rules fail to adapt to evolving attack techniques. Attackers quickly learn to bypass rigid thresholds by going "low and slow."</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">Patterns offer a more flexible and scalable approach to threat detection. Instead of relying on static conditions, patterns focus on behavioral anomalies and trends:</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Patterns identify unusual activities that deviate from baseline behavior, such as:</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Patterns inherently group events, reducing the volume of alerts and prioritizing critical incidents.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Patterns evolve with the system. For example, a spike in failed logins can trigger an alert only when it surpasses the user's historical norm.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Patterns focus on correlations and chains of events, such as a rare IP access combined with lateral movement, leading to more accurate detections.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">The MITRE ATT&CK Framework exemplifies the power of patterns.

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 text-[#ff9d00]">1. Unplanned Downtime</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Unexpected equipment failures disrupt schedules and increase costs. AI agents detect anomalies early, helping prevent escalation.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 text-[#ff9d00]">2. Quality Control</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Defects and inconsistencies damage customer trust. With AI-powered monitoring, deviations are caught in real time, reducing waste and rework.</p>

There has been a 71% year-over-year increase in cyberattacks that used stolen or compromised credentials. Security Operations Centers (SOCs) play a central role in managing organizational cybersecurity, providing real-time monitoring, incident detection, and response capabilities.</p>
